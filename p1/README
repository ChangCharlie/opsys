The G(raham) Shell

To Compile:
	$ make clean
	$ make all

To Run:
	$ ./gshell

To Use:
	The G(raham) Shell operates similar to any other shell, albeit with reduced functionality. Enter commands at the prompt:
		>> rm -Rf *
	^ probably not a good idea.
	The G(raham) Shell accepts commands with and without arguments, input and output redirection:
		>> ls -R / > file
		>> wc < file
	As well as compounding commands:
		>> ls -R && wc file
	And backgrounding processes:
		>> sleep 5 &
		Backgrounding 1231...
		>> 1234 Terminated!
		>>
	Additionally, the internal command "exit" is supported:
		>> exit
		Exiting!
	As an added bonus, the user can change the prompt characters:
		>> chp g:
		Changing prompt!
		g:
