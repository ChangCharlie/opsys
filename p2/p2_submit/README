CMPS 111: Project 2 - Scheduler
Graham Greving
ggreving@ucsc.edu

This is my scheduler, I have included the implementation and rules for 
my own personal lottery scheme, however did not have time to implement 
them.

Included files:
schedproc.h
	lives in /usr/src/servers/sched
	modifies the schedproc struct to include a number of tickets
schedule_vanilla.c
	lives in /usr/src/servers/sched
	implements a plain lottery schedule system
schedule_dynamic.c
	lives in /usr/src/servers/sched
	implements a dynamic lottery schedule system

To make the vanilla lottery scheduler:
	# make vanilla
To make the dynamic lottery scheduler:
	# make dynamic
These two make commands copy the necessary files to their appropriate 
destinations and issue the 'make install' command from /usr/src/tools to 
recompile the kernel.

To run either scheduler:
	from the prompt run:
		shutdown
	from the bootloader run:
		image=/boot/image/3.1.8rX
	where X is the most recent boot image
